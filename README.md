Overview: 
- The purpose of this repository is to hold the documents for each site reworked over the week. 

Goal:
- Each week pick a new website who's front-end I want to rework. It doesn't have to be one that I think I can improve or even want to change but moreso focusing on projects and sites that I really enjoy and use quite consistently.
